I always wanted to write a blog. Just kidding never thought of it. But due to the constant nagging of some seniors, I am writing it. Thank you guys for atleast getting it started. 

I am bad when something comes up to writing, so bear it or else you have other options like `ctrl+w`. I doubt anyone would use the latter options because nobody would be visiting it unless I force them to.
Atleast it would help me keep the documentation of my work at one place. If I had started writing about my experiences and projects from the start, this would definitely reach atleast the second page. But it's never to late to start. :)

So from now I am gonna dump all my well framed thoughts, views and events that happened in my life here.

I will request all the people who love to critise poor writing skills, keep your nose out. I am working on it.

PS- I'll try to keep the blog alive.
