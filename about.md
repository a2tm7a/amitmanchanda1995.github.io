Hi

I am Amit Manchanda, a sophomore bachelor in Electronics and Communication Engineering, [IIT Roorkee](http://www.iitr.ac.in/).

My areas of interest are not fixed. It would definatly have changed the second time you meet me.

I believe in a saying 

>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. 

>By Mark Twain 

so I dont want anything to left behind.

I am interested in higher studies and during some research in Electronics or Communication field.

I am a Web and Android Developer at [SDS (Software Development Section)](https://sdslabs.co/). I have worked in PHP, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS.

After spending 2 years in IIT, I can say that my programming basics are clear and learing no new language is a bit deal.

I keep my projects at [GitHub](https://github.com/amitmanchanda1995/).

Message me at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/amit.manchanda.27).

Or Connect with me [Linkedin](https://in.linkedin.com/in/amit-manchanda-154694a8).

Passion is yet to be found within me.
